**Baitwatch** is a deep learning project for automated fish analysis in underwater imagery from BRUV (Baited Remote Underwater Video) deployments. Built on the **Tassie BRUV** benchmark dataset (2025), it trains convolutional neural network (CNN) models to answer two questions from a single photograph:

1. 🐟 **Is there a fish in this image?** — **FONF** (Fish Or No Fish): binary detection model
2. 🔬 **What species is it?** — **IFSP** (Individual Fish Species Prediction): multi-class species classification model

A stretch objective explores **transfer learning with YOLO26** for end-to-end fish detection and classification in a single forward pass.

## 🌊 Background

Monitoring marine biodiversity is essential for conservation management, yet it is costly and labour-intensive when done manually. BRUV systems provide a reproducible, non-invasive sampling method — but reviewing hours of footage requires significant expert time.

**Baitwatch** automates two core annotation tasks:

- **FONF (Fish Or No Fish)** — filters out empty frames, reducing the volume of footage that needs expert review by orders of magnitude.
- **IFSP (Individual Fish Species Prediction)** — identifies *which* species is present, enabling biodiversity indices to be computed automatically.

The project treats each task as a **separate, independently used CNN**, trained end-to-end on still frames extracted from the Tassie BRUV dataset. Both models share a common image preprocessing pipeline but are invoked independently at inference time via a **FastAPI** REST API. As a stretch goal, a fine-tuned **YOLO26** model combines both tasks into a single object detection network.

## 📦 Dataset

**Tassie BRUV: A benchmark data set for computer vision and movement quantification algorithms** (2025)

The Tassie BRUV dataset contains annotated underwater images collected using stereo BRUV rigs deployed off the coast of Tasmania, Australia. It is designed explicitly to benchmark computer vision algorithms under ecologically realistic conditions: variable water clarity, complex reef backgrounds, partial occlusions, and significant class imbalance due to the natural rarity of certain species.

| Property | Details |
|---|---|
| Media type | Still frames extracted from MP4 BRUV video sequences |
| Annotation format | Bounding boxes + species labels (YOLO format — per-image `.txt` files) |
| Total annotations | 5,222 fish bounding boxes across 1,912 labelled frames |
| Raw species | 19 fish species identified at species level |
| Grouped classes | 8 classes (rare species merged into higher-order taxonomic groups) |
| Key challenge | Severe class imbalance — *Platycephalus bassensis* alone accounts for 3,834 of 5,222 annotations |
| Environment | Temperate reef habitat, Tasmania, Australia |
| Training / Val / Test split | 1,340 / 192 / 380 frames |

### Species Classes

The 19 raw species observed in the dataset are grouped into **8 classification classes** used for model training, after merging taxa with low annotation counts into morphologically similar higher-order groups. The dominant class by a large margin is the **Southern Sand Flathead** (*Platycephalus bassensis*), a camouflaged benthic species that accounts for ~73% of all annotations.

| Class ID | Class Name | Common Name | Approx. Annotations (train split) | Notes |
|---|---|---|-----------------------------------|-------|
| 0 | `Carcharhiniformes` | Ground sharks | 168                               | —     |
| 1 | `Chyrosophyrs auratus` | Australasian Snapper | 210                               | —     |
| 2 | `Moridae` | Morid cods | 67                                | —     |
| 3 | `Perciformes_sandy` | Sandy-habitat perch-like fishes | 87                                | —     |
| 4 | `Perciformes_silver` | Silver perch-like fishes | 292                               | —     |
| 5 | `Ray` | Rays | 93                                | —     |
| 6 | `Scorpaeniformes` | Scorpionfish & flatheads | 2660                              | —     |
| 7 | `Tetradontiformes` | Pufferfish & filefish | 70                                | —     |

> **Note:** Class names and IDs match those defined in `training_data_species_grouped/data.yaml`. Refer to the paper *"The Motion Picture"* (Maslen et al., 2025) for the full grouping rationale.

> **Access:** Download the dataset from the official data portal (see reference *Tassie BRUV: A benchmark data set for computer vision and movement quantification algorithms*. Dryad.). Place the raw data under `raw_data/` folder.

## 🔬 Pipeline Overview

FONF and IFSP are trained and served **independently**, but share a common preprocessing pipeline. Preprocessed images are **saved to disk** before any training begins, so both models consume the same processed outputs at their respective resolutions.

    F --> H[(model/ifsp/)]

    G --> I[4. FastAPI\nPOST /detect-fishes/\ndetection_type: fonf / ifsp]
    H --> I
```

### Data Preparation

Since the Tassie BRUV dataset ships with annotations already in **YOLO format** (per-image `.txt` files containing `class_id cx cy w h` normalised coordinates), no format conversion is required. The preparation scripts parse these labels directly to build the **FONF** binary detection and **IFSP** species classification datasets:

```bash
make run_preprocess_fonf   # prepare and save FONF dataset (256×144)
make run_preprocess_ifsp   # crop on bounding box → resize + black padding to 256×105 + image enhancement
```

### Preprocessing

All images go through a shared base pipeline before model-specific resizing, implemented with **OpenCV**:

1. **Auto white balance** — corrects the strong blue/green colour cast inherent to underwater imagery, improving colour consistency across frames recorded at different depths and times of day.
2. **Contrast stretching** — linearly rescales pixel intensities to the full [0, 255] range, compensating for low-contrast scenes caused by light attenuation underwater.
3. **Resize** — images are resized to the resolution expected by each model, with different strategies per model:

| Model | Resize strategy | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| FONF | Direct resize | 256 × 144 px |
| IFSP | Crop on bounding box → resize → black padding (preserves fish aspect ratio) | 256 × 105 px |

### Image Enhancement for IFSP (Class Imbalance)

To improve IFSP generalisation and help address class imbalance, image enhancement is applied to **all training images** regardless of class. Combined with `class_weight` during training, this ensures the model is exposed to varied representations of every species. Enhancement is applied to the **training set only** — validation and test sets use original images exclusively.

- **Random horizontal flip** — doubles effective sample count at no cost
- **Random rotation** — accounts for varying fish orientations in BRUV footage
- **Random zoom** — simulates different distances from the camera
- **Random brightness & contrast jitter** — simulates variable depth lighting and turbidity
- **Gaussian noise** — simulates sensor and compression artefacts

Enhanced images are saved to `processed_data/ifsp_augmented/`, organised as follows:

```
processed_data/ifsp_augmented/
├── train/
│   ├── 0/    # Carcharhiniformes
│   ├── 1/    # Chyrosophyrs auratus
│   ├── ...
│   └── 7/    # Tetradontiformes
├── test/     # original images only — no augmentation applied
│   ├── 0/
│   └── ...
└── val/      # original images only — no augmentation applied
    ├── 0/
    └── ...
```

### Preprocessing Outputs

After running the preprocessing and augmentation commands, the full `processed_data/` directory is structured as follows:

- `processed_data/fonf/` — images organized into `fish/` and `no_fish/` subdirectories at 256×144, ready for `keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory`.
- `processed_data/ifsp/` — images cropped on bounding box, resized with black padding to 256×105, organized by species label.
- `processed_data/ifsp_augmented/` — produced by `make run_augment_ifsp`; enhanced training images for all classes, organized by split (`train/`, `test/`, `val/`) then by class ID (`0/`, `1/`, …`7/`).

---

## 🚀 Usage

All workflow steps are available as `make` commands. Run them in order the first time you set up the project.

### 1. Download the dataset

```bash
make run_dl_data
```

Downloads the Tassie BRUV dataset and places it under `raw_data/`.

### 2. Preprocess & save images

```bash
make run_preprocess_fonf   # auto white balance + contrast stretch + resize to 256×144
make run_preprocess_ifsp   # auto white balance + contrast stretch + crop on bounding box
                           # → resize + black padding to 256×105
make run_augment_ifsp      # apply image enhancement to IFSP minority classes (training set only)
                           # requires run_preprocess_ifsp to be run first
```

Preprocessed images are saved to disk under `processed_data/` before any training begins.

### 3. Train models

```bash
make run_train_fonf   # train the FONF binary detector
make run_train_ifsp   # train the IFSP species classifier
```

Trained model weights are saved to `model/fonf/` and `model/ifsp/` respectively.

### 4. Evaluate models

```bash
make run_evaluate_fonf   # evaluate FONF on the test split (never-seen images)
make run_evaluate_ifsp   # evaluate IFSP on the test split (never-seen images)
```

Runs inference on the held-out test set — images the models have never seen during training or validation — and outputs evaluation metrics.

### 5. Classification report

```bash
make run_report_fonf   # display classification report for FONF
make run_report_ifsp   # display classification report for IFSP
```

Prints per-class precision, recall, F1 and overall accuracy.

### 6. Start the API

```bash
make run_api
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`. Interactive documentation is auto-generated at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

### API — `POST /detect-fishes/`

Both models are served through a single endpoint. The `detection_type` parameter selects which model to run.

| Parameter | Type | Values | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `detection_type` | `string` | `"fonf"` \| `"ifsp"` | Model to use for inference |
| `file` | `image file` | `.jpg`, `.png` | Underwater image to analyse |

**Example — FONF (fish / no fish):**

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/detect-fishes/" \
     -F "detection_type=fonf" \
     -F "file=@path/to/image.jpg"
```

```json
{
  "probability": 0.97,
  "class_id": 1
}
```

> For FONF: `class_id` is `1` (fish) or `0` (no fish).

**Example — IFSP (species identification):**

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/detect-fishes/" \
     -F "detection_type=ifsp" \
     -F "file=@path/to/image.jpg"
```

```json
{
  "probability": 0.84,
  "class_id": 6
}
```

> For IFSP: `class_id` maps to the predicted species class (e.g. `6` → `Scorpaeniformes`). Refer to the [Species Classes](#species-classes) table for the full class ID mapping.

---

## 🏗 Model Architectures

Both models are **custom CNNs built from scratch** using the Keras functional API, without any pre-trained weights. All models are saved in the native `.keras` format. Each model has its own input resolution reflecting the aspect ratio of cropped BRUV frames after preprocessing.

### FONF — Fish Or No Fish (Binary Detector)

A lightweight binary classifier. Input images are resized to **256 × 144 px** before being fed to the network.

### IFSP — Individual Fish Species Prediction (Species Classifier)

A deeper CNN for fine-grained species identification across the **8 grouped classes** of the Tassie BRUV dataset. Input images are cropped on the fish bounding box, then resized with black padding to **256 × 105 px** to preserve the original fish aspect ratio.

## ⚖️ Handling Class Imbalance

Class imbalance is the central challenge for IFSP: *Scorpaeniformes* (dominated by *Platycephalus bassensis*) accounts for ~73% of all annotations, while several species classes have fewer than ten examples. Baitwatch addresses this at three levels:

**Data level** — Image enhancement (flips, rotations, zoom, brightness/contrast jitter, Gaussian noise) is applied to **all IFSP training images** and saved to `processed_data/ifsp_augmented/`. Stratified splits preserve the original class distribution across train, validation, and test sets.

**Training level** — `class_weight` is passed to `model.fit()` during IFSP training, computed from inverse class frequencies. This penalises the model more heavily for misclassifying rare species, compensating for the dominant presence of *Scorpaeniformes*.

**Loss level** — `BinaryCrossentropy` for FONF.; `CategoricalCrossentropy` for IFSP

**Evaluation level** — Per-class F1 and recall are always reported alongside overall accuracy, so strong performance on the dominant class cannot mask failure on rare ones.

Class weights are computed automatically from inverse class frequencies at training time.

---

## 📈 Results

The following metrics are tracked for each model:

| Metric | Task | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Accuracy | Both | Overall; insufficient alone under class imbalance |
| F1 Score (macro) | Both | Treats all classes equally — key metric for rare species |
| Per-class Recall | IFSP | Species-level sensitivity; critical for biodiversity monitoring |
| Confusion Matrix | Both | Displayed via `make run_report_*` |
| ROC-AUC | FONF | Binary classification quality across all thresholds |

Metrics computed on the **validation set** unless noted. Confusion matrices available via `make run_report_fonf` / `make run_report_ifsp`.

To contextualise model performance, each CNN is compared against a naive baseline that requires no training. A meaningful model must clearly outperform these baselines — particularly on rare species — to justify the complexity of a deep learning approach.

### FONF — Fish Or No Fish

**FONF baseline — Majority class classifier:**

Always predicts the most frequent class in the training set (fish or no fish, whichever is more common). Any FONF model must exceed this accuracy and, critically, achieve substantially higher recall on the minority class.

| Model | Accuracy | F1 (macro) | ROC-AUC |
|---|---|---|---|
| Majority class baseline | ~56% | — | 0.50 |
| FONF (custom CNN) | **0.89** | **0.89** | **0.92** *(test)* |

**Per-class results on the validation set (192 samples):**

| Class | Precision | Recall | F1 | Support |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| No fish | 0.89 | 0.86 | 0.87 | 84 |
| Fish | 0.89 | 0.92 | 0.90 | 108 |
| **Macro avg** | **0.89** | **0.89** | **0.89** | 192 |
| Weighted avg | 0.89 | 0.89 | 0.89 | 192 |

### IFSP — Individual Fish Species Prediction

**IFSP baseline — Uniform random classifier:**

Predicts each of the 8 species classes with equal probability (1/8 = 12.5% per class). Given the severe imbalance in the dataset, a model that simply predicts *Scorpaeniformes* every time would score high accuracy but near-zero macro F1 — this stratified random baseline avoids that trap.

| Model | Accuracy | F1 (macro) | Rare Species Recall |
|---|---|---|---|
| Uniform random baseline | ~12.5% | ~12.5% | ~12.5% |
| Majority class baseline | ~73% | — | ~0% |
| IFSP (custom CNN) | **0.71** | **0.59** | **0.40–0.81** |

**Per-class results on the validation set (479 samples):**

| Class | Name | Precision | Recall | F1 | Support |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Carcharhiniformes | 0.54 | 0.71 | 0.61 | 21 |
| 1 | Chyrosophyrs auratus | 0.84 | 0.81 | 0.82 | 26 |
| 2 | Moridae | 0.67 | 0.40 | 0.50 | 15 |

| 6 | Scorpaeniformes | 0.94 | 0.74 | 0.83 | 336 |
| 7 | Tetradontiformes | 0.57 | 0.40 | 0.47 | 10 |
| — | **Macro avg** | **0.61** | **0.60** | **0.59** | 479 |

## 🎯 Stretch Objective: Transfer Learning with YOLO26

> **Status:** Experimental.

The two-stage CNN pipeline performs detection and classification as separate steps. As a stretch goal, **YOLO26** is fine-tuned on the Tassie BRUV dataset to perform both tasks simultaneously: localising each fish with a bounding box and assigning its species label in a single forward pass.

This approach mirrors the methodology described in *"The Motion Picture: Leveraging Movement to Enhance AI Object Detection in Ecology"*, which demonstrated that transfer learning from large-scale pre-trained weights substantially improves detection of rare and cryptic marine species compared to training from scratch.

### Why YOLO26?

- Pre-trained on COCO (120K images, 80 classes) — strong low-level feature representations transfer well to underwater imagery.
- State-of-the-art speed/accuracy trade-off for real-time ecological monitoring.
- Native support for custom datasets and fine-tuning with minimal configuration.

### Setup

```bash
pip install ultralytics
```

### Prepare the dataset configuration

Since the Tassie BRUV annotations are **already in YOLO format**, no conversion is needed. Simply generate the `dataset.yaml` configuration file pointing to the raw label and image directories:

```bash
python baitwatch/data/prepare_yolo_config.py \
    --image_dir raw_data/images \
    --label_dir raw_data/labels \
    --output raw_data/dataset.yaml
```

The resulting `dataset.yaml` follows the standard Ultralytics structure:

```yaml
path: raw_data
train: images/train
val: images/val
test: images/test

nc: <N_species>
names: [<species_1>, <species_2>, ...]
```

### Fine-tune YOLO26

```bash
python baitwatch/models/yolo_wrapper.py \
    --config configs/yolo_finetune.yaml \
    --data raw_data/dataset.yaml \
    --weights yolo26m.pt \
    --epochs 100 \
    --output_dir model/yolo
```

Key fine-tuning strategies applied:

- **Frozen backbone** for the first N epochs, then end-to-end fine-tuning — avoids catastrophic forgetting on small datasets.
- **Mosaic augmentation** enabled (YOLO26 default) — especially effective for rare classes with few training images.
- **Class-weighted loss** — rare species receive higher gradient contribution during training.

### Inference with the fine-tuned YOLO model

```bash
python -m baitwatch.inference_yolo \
    --model model/yolo/weights/best.pt \
    --image_dir path/to/new/images \
    --output_csv yolo_predictions.csv \
    --conf_threshold 0.3
```

### Comparison: Custom CNN pipeline vs. YOLO26

| Aspect | FONF + IFSP (from scratch) | YOLO26 (fine-tuned) |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-trained weights | None | COCO (120K images) |
| Task | Classification only | Detection + classification |
| Localisation | No (image-level labels) | Yes (bounding boxes) |
| Training data needed | High | Low–medium |
| Rare species performance | Baseline | Expected improvement |
| Inference speed | Fast | Fast |
| Interpretability | Confusion matrix + per-class metrics | Built-in confidence scores |

### Results — YOLO26 Fine-tuned

| Metric | Val | Test |
|---|---|---|
| mAP@0.5 | — | — |
| mAP@0.5:0.95 | — | — |
| Rare Species Recall | — | — |

## 🔬 Stretch Objective: Grad-CAM Visualisation *(not met)*

> **Status:** Not implemented — planned for a future iteration.

The goal was to integrate **Grad-CAM** (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) to produce heatmap overlays highlighting the image regions most influential to each model's prediction. This would have provided a lightweight interpretability tool to help domain experts validate model behaviour and identify spurious correlations (e.g. a model attending to background reef texture rather than fish morphology).

**Why it was not completed** — time constraints during the current project cycle.

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Both FONF and IFSP process each frame independently — no temporal context from surrounding video frames is used.
- IFSP does not perform bounding-box regression; it classifies at image level, assuming the fish fills most of the frame.
- Training and evaluation are scoped to Tasmanian reef habitats; performance on other ecosystems is untested.
- The YOLO26 stretch objective requires conversion to a non-Keras framework (`ultralytics`); a unified Keras-only detection pipeline is not yet implemented.

**Possible improvements:**

- **Temporal modelling** — exploiting frame sequences with ConvLSTM or video transformer models could improve detection of cryptic or transiently visible species.
- **Semi-supervised learning** — leveraging the large volume of unannotated BRUV footage via pseudo-labelling or consistency regularisation could improve generalisation.
- **Stereo data** — the dataset includes stereo pairs; depth information from stereo disparity could improve size-based species disambiguation.
- **On-device deployment** — TensorFlow Lite conversion could enable deployment on field-deployable hardware alongside BRUV rigs.
